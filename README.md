The jaribo project was a 2015 - 2017 project that me and some friends made using what we barely knew of bash. 
The project was to make (using the [arp-sk](https://manned.org/arp-sk/99e329e1) library for arp  manipulations) a network jammer.

The logic is simplistic, we would either target a specific device or the whole network, and using the arp, the program poisons the router's arp table.

This project is out of support, and its here just as a relic of old times.
(Also, all the interfaces are in Spanish)
